## Miscellaneous Nicheknights

| Niche | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Low Op Count | Limited operator slots |
| No-repeat Operators/ Intcomp | Mimicks the [Interlocking Competition](https://arknights.wiki.gg/wiki/Interlocking_Competition_Hymnoi_Wisdom) event mechanic: Operators can only be used in one stage each run. Usually, each 'run' refers to one side story, and may or may not include standard, EX, S, or MO stages. |
| 1P Relay | Only one operator on the field at a time. Usually, deployment limit is the indicator for 'one operator', so the usage of robots is lenient. |
| 1 Tile Only | Only one tile on the field can be occupied throughout map. A stricter version of the 1P Relay. Deployable objects, e.g. Interference Mines, Mr. Boom, etc. are generally not allowed outside of the specific tile. |
| Speedrun | Clear a stage as fast as possible. Time is measured at 2x speed. Usually done to optimise farming |
| Boss Speedrun | Kill a boss as fast as possible. Time is measured at 2x speed from the point the boss is technically killable. |

## Rules

- Only operators 'below B- rank' (Based on [this list](https://web.archive.org/web/20240613032632/https://gamepress.gg/arknights/tier-list/arknights-operator-tier-list)) can be used  
  This ensures that there is at more than 1 medic, 1 defender, and a marksman sniper.
- Only the lowest ranked operators of each subclass can be used  
  That is, if the lowest-ranked core caster is C-tier, you can only use C-tier core casters.
- Only 4* operators and above  
  This prevents this niche from becoming low-rarity only.
- Use the lowest-ranked operators to complete stages where possible

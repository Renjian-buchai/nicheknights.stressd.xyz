# Clutterknights

"If I can't stand there, no one else can"

## Rules

- The unit must summon objects to other tiles.  
  This rules out operators that summon objects on themselves, e.g. Mudrock and her shield
- The summon must prevent operators from being deployed on their tile.  
  This rules out stuff like Ines' sentry
- The summon mustn't take up a deployment slot  
  This rules out most summoners and operators that mimic them.
- The unit mustn't be from the summoner class  
  This rules out summoner with the X module.

# Heituknights

??? Idk why this artist specifically???

I think it's because all of these operators basically have the same face, so heitu's face is a meme in the CN community, but no evidence for what makes this unique

Proposed by [u/ode-2-sleep](https://www.reddit.com/user/ode-2-sleep)

## Rules

- The operator or an operator's skin must be credited to one of the following: 幻想黑兔, *Huanxiang Heitu*, *Genzou Kurousagi* or Coney Rivard.  
  There are no skins for operators that he did not draw. However, it is still included for clarity.

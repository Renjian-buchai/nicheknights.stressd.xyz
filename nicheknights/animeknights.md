# Animeknights

If they're not in anime, they're not canonâ„¢

I'm too busy to watch the entire Arknights anime again to confirm that it exists, so I'm going off of the list proposed [below]({{site.url}}/animeknights#animeknightsList). Sorry!

{: .note }
> This list has only been updated as of Season 2. I added the list for the OVAs myself based on the wiki[^1] [^2]. Maybe more operators show up in the background, idk.

Proposed by: p.zwolin on <a id="animeknightsList">[animeknights](https://animeknights.carrd.co/)</a>

## Rules

- The operator must appear in the Arknights anime.
  This includes:
  1. Arknights: Prelude to Dawn (Season 1)
  2. Arknights: Perish in Frost (Season 2)
  3. Arknights: Rise from Ember (Season 3)
  4. Holy Knight Light (Arknights Global 1st Anniversary OVA)
  5. Lee's Detective Agency: A Day in Lungmen (Arknights CN 3rd Anniversary OVA)

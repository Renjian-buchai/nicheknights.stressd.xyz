# Freeknights

Working for my operators? Imagine that.

## Rules

- The unit must be given out for free without the usage of orundums or recruitment.

> Some players do not believe that freeknights players should be allowed to obtain potentials through recruitments. Getting potentials is irreversible, so please take note of this!
